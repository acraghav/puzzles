## Puzzle Contest Continued

During the last week I received 19 letters from TopCoder members wishing me good luck at TCO. I was oh so impressed with all the positive feelings people have towards me! Thank you so much, I love you too!

And then I got to writing this post, and recalled that this was the answer to Puzzle #1. Oh the hard reality. Right, this puzzle was that simple ‚Äì first letters of the paragraphs of my post spelled ‚ÄúG-O-O-D-L-U-C-K-A-T-T-C-O‚Äù. This was the easiest cipher I could think of ‚Äì but you don't want to know how much time I spent filling the template with text which wouldn't be complete nonsense üòâ

Meanwhile, I don't want to keep you waiting for next puzzle, so here it is, hidden in this post again and worth 3 points. 

And now the bad news. I had a lovely blog post (TC spirit, you know) written for today, but alas! I have to hesitate to post it, because today is an unexpected holiday here in Ukraine. I'll have to wait until next week with this one, because early tomorrow morning I depart for Challenge 24 finals in Hungary. I will be away till Monday, so please forgive me delays in processing your letters up to, say, 25 hours.

I have another blog post scheduled for end of this week ‚Äì 2 posts per week seem necessary to keep up with everybody. After all, my fun is not the only purpose of choosing me as a blogger, not even the main one. Last year I wrote a total of 25 posts, and I expect to do at least as much this year, and probably more, and I hope you'll like it at least twice as much üòâ

### Hints and Solution

First hint:
<details>
Focus on the numbers mentioned in the article.
</details>

Second hint:
<details>
The numbers alone, if viewed outside of the post, won't give you the answer, neither will the post without the numbers. You have to combine both to get it.
</details>

Solution (read at your own risk!):
<details>
To solve this puzzle, one should note the overactive usage of numbers in the post (or simply read the first hint). After some playing with the numbers they would figure out that the numbers 19, 1, 3, 24, 25, 2, 25 alone or combined with letters don‚Äôt decode into anything better than SACXYBY (or read the second hint) and turn to playing with words of the text. After some more time of banging one‚Äôs head against the walls the solution might emerge: for every number _N_ in the text, take the _N_-th (1-based) word from the paragraph in which this number appeared. This gives the answer ‚Äì ‚ÄúOh, and don't hesitate to have fun!‚Äù, which is the second part of my TCO-opening wish to my readers.
