## Know Your Community

One of the best things about TopCoder is the community that has formed around it over the decade of its existence. It's as versatile as one can wish, and getting to know people who do TopCoder is both thrilling and rewarding. Some members naturally get more publicity than others â€“ just check how often are top Algorithm competitors mentioned in conversations out here! But as soon as you get to know any TopCoder member (as, I guess, any person), you'll realize that there's something incredible about him, something you could never guess without knowing... Or could you?

Here is a list of curious facts about some members of the community. Some of them can be linked to the members after some research, while the others are a complete surprise (at least they were for me). Some of them are contests-related, while the others refer to personal life. To crack the third puzzle of this year's Puzzle Contest, you have to figure out the mapping of the facts to the members and send it to me. To make it easier, I'm giving you not only the facts but also the members they are about. There are more members than facts, so you can't return a completely random permutation of handles ðŸ˜‰

### Answer

<details>
This puzzle was a really fun one. The best thing about it was reading the guesses, especially the wrong ones. For example, quite a lot of people attributed earning the A+ grade for the shortest code to me. I've studied only in Ukraine, and here we don't have A+ score â€“ our scoring system is 2-5 in university, or 1-12 in school. This must be something about my public image that makes this fact the most likely one...

This puzzle was also a pretty mean one. I put in several people who looked like they matched the facts about other people to see how easily you're tricked, and sometimes this worked. Ok, enough talking, on to the answers!

1. Appeared on two game shows â€“ "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" and "Wheel of Fortune".  
This was **connect4**, last year's blogger who invented this puzzle and gracefully provided me with this fact.
2. Was a commentator for World Cyber Games in 2007.  
**theycallhimtom** was picked for creating a Warcraft 3 highlights show.
3. Got an A+ grade for a class entirely because of having written a programming assignment one character shorter than the instructorâ€™s solution.  
Fellow blogger **Rustyoldman** provided me with way more facts than I needed :-), and I picked this one because it allowed me to put in a false clue pointing to **venco**.
4. Submitted to contests in Shakespeare, Whitespace, Golfscript, False, LOLCODE, Piet etc.  
No, it's not me again â€“ I know some of these languages, but I've never used them in a contest. Haven't used them _yet_, this is, but the correct answer was quite possible to find out â€“ **bozzball** makes his Google Code Jam qualifications as rainbow as he can.
5. Studied in the same college as the crown princess of Denmark.  
This was another trick question: I put in **gmark** of Denmark, but a simple research would have shown that Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, studied in Australia, thus the correct answer is **dimkadimon**.
6. As a youngster, was kissed on the cheeks by Muhammad Ali.  
I was suspected of this as well, but this is something I would never let happen â€“ this is about **NeverMore**.
7. Took part in contests from Amundsen-Scott station, South Pole.  
**Nil_ct** mentioned this in NASA-TopCoder Challenge forum, and a simple search like "site:topcoder.com South Pole" would have brought this up. I meant this to be a consolatory question, but surprisingly not everybody got it right.
8. Was screen-tested for commercials.  
I know you're all impatient to know which of the facts is about me (right?) â€“ this one is. I was like 12, and the test was to imagine that I was conjuring myself a tail â€“ no wonder I didn't get in ðŸ˜‰
9. Used to have four 2s as his lucky number.  
I really needed some fact about one of people I've put in as false clues, and after some really thorough forum search I've found this ages-old-fact about **venco**.
