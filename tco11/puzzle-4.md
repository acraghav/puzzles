## Puzzle #4

Two months ago I promised you more puzzles.

So light-minded.

My trip to Florida is only a week away, and I'm running out of time. Yet a promise made is one to be kept.

This post is puzzle #4, a simple one worth 1 point, with a finalist's handle hidden somewhere in it.

You have to send me your guess by September 24th. This weekend I'll publish the last puzzle, and announce Puzzle Contest winner while in Florida. Enjoy!

### Solution

Puzzle #4 turned out to be surprisingly hard – even more challenging than #2, though the code I used for it looked much easier to me. Once I've realized that I'm still missing two puzzles and have only one of them drafted, I had very limited time to put together something puzzle-like. I've already used encryptions based on certain letters and numbers in the post, so what was left? Right, the whitespace between the words.

To decode the message from the text, one had to count the spaces in each paragraph and to convert the numbers to corresponding letters of English alphabet (a letter corresponds to its 1-based index in the alphabet). The result will be "gawry" – this code is not easy to apply to long messages.
