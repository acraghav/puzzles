## Meet Nickolas, TCO blogger again (a.k.a. Puzzle #1)

Greetings!

Of course, everybody who follows this blog has already read Rustyoldman's ["Hello World"](https://community.topcoder.com/tco11/2011/04/16/oh-noes-not-him-again/), thus they already know that TCO'11 has 4 bloggers, and I'm one of them (again). This spares me of the need to bring you these news, and allows to start my blog right away.

On the list of things I've planned for year 2011, "To attend TCO'11" is listed under number 8, between "To run a contest on esoteric programming languages" and "To attend Challenge24 finals". After all, I already have a USA multi-visa for 5 years, so there is no real reason to miss this one â€“ as well as next three ðŸ˜‰

Don't know about the rest of the list yet, but I'm going to Challenge24 next week, and to TCO'11 in September. I don't think accepting the invitation took me as long as two thousand milliseconds â€“ basically I've had the decision ready beforehand, much the same as when I'm offered to write a problem for TopCoder. Why?

Las Vegas was amazing. Now that I think about it, I've missed a lot of must-see and must-do things, like taking a shot at one-armed bandits or at the Facebook interview. I wasn't prepared to explore Las Vegas, so I owe most of what I've seen to other Russian-speaking finalists. Still I've seen enough to get the taste of this city, and it's completely unlike any other place I've been to. I was really looking forward to revisiting it and seeing the white tigers again, but...

Unexpectedly, this year TCO goes to a new location â€“ Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Some people (ahem!) are skeptical about this choice of site, but I'm positively thrilled! First, it's the ocean; people who have it might think it nothing special, but I've never yet touched it, and can't wait to! Second, it's the time zone; Florida is 3 hours closer to my native time zone than Las Vegas, though the flight times are approximately the same, and this means shorter jetlag. Last but not least, it's a chance to see a completely new place with plenty of sightseeing, parks and everything to make one completely abandon their blogging duties ðŸ˜‰

Clearly, this was the reason TopCoder decided to have four on-site bloggers instead of two, â€“ the workload on each blogger on-site will be twice lower, and the chances to see the city will be more abundant, which is good for the blog â€“ and the bloggers' mental health as well, since nothing hurts it more than blogging all day long and exploring the city only at night. I blame this and my sleep deprivation for the gloomy impression I've left on some people I've met on-site â€“ typically I'm much more cheerful. (See? I'm getting grumpy again at the mere thought of how sleepy I was)

Keen on getting on-site this year again, I did my best last year â€“ and it seems to have paid off. Now, the task is to do better this year.

At first glance, four bloggers make blogging about on-line part of the tournament easier â€“ there will always be something new to read, and each blogger will have to do less posts per month. Nicely relaxed schedule both on-line and on-site, good company and a lot of things happening to blog about â€“ what can be wrong about it?

The bad news are that I share blogging about Algorithm and Marathon tracks with Rustyoldman. Judging from his blogging schedule, I'll have a tough time both keeping up with him and writing something he hasn't yet written. Oh well, if everything TopCoder does is done via competition, why the blog should be any different?

The good news are that I'll have to get really inventive, and you might like the results. Of course there will be another Puzzle Contest this year. I don't have a plan yet; this means that I won't be sticking to a certain topic but rather improvising, and the puzzles will be more versatile than last year. As usual, to compete in each puzzle challenge, you'll have to send me a message via Member Contact with the solution. This year I'll use a simplified scoring scheme: correct solution to each puzzle will be worth a pre-defined amount of points, partial solutions will get part of the score, and ties will be resolved with respect to submission time.

Conveniently, this year we seem to have forum threads associated with our blog posts; I'll use this post's thread to announce new puzzles and to discuss previous ones, so make sure to watch it for updates. Keep an eye on the blog itself as well â€“ I won't be limiting myself to puzzles, and hopefully you'll find my writing worth reading. Stay tuned!

Oh, and thereâ€™s one more thing I have to mention. The puzzle contest has already started, and this post actually is the first puzzle of the series, worth 1 point. Enjoy!
